  description:  "Vendors have closely integrated reconfigurable logic (e.g., FPGAs) into
multicores that enable the software community to realize accelerators for
specific program regions.  We propose a methodical LLVM-based compiler
approach to answer the question, what is acceleratable? and help software
developers with early stage exploration of acceleration targets. Our
hypothesis is that an entirely new program execution-based abstraction is
needed to extract acceleratable regions from programs to help hardware
synthesis tools. [IISWC'16,HPCA'16]"

  description: "Chip designers
have shown increasing interest in integrating specialized fixed-function
coprocessors. With increasing energy cost of wires and caches relative to
compute operations, it is imperative to optimize data movement to retain the
energy benefits of accelerators. We have developed a lightweight coherent cache
hierarchy for accelerators to optimize the data movement. We are studying coherence based memory models for both GPUs 
  [HPCA'13] and fixed-function coprocessors [ISCA'15]."
